# Wumpus-world
Using a knowladge based agent to solve [Wumpus-world](https://www.javatpoint.com/the-wumpus-world-in-artificial-intelligence) problem

## How to use the program?
- In the config.txt file the user can pick a size of the grid that will be displayed (note: default size is 5 and minimum size is 2)
- To select a square double click it
- To move wumpus select a square and press 'w' on the keyboard
- To move gold select a square and press 'g' on the keyboard
- To add/remove a pit select a square and press 'p' on the keyboard
- When play button is pressed, the agent will try to find the gold and display the animation
- Help button is there to show the controls
